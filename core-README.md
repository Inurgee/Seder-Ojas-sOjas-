The soja Constitution: GitHub README.md
This manifest defines the transition from traditional "Information Technology" to Computational Physiology. The Seder-Ojas (soja) system is a biomorphic entity where the operating system is managed as a living organism.
I. Core Philosophy
 * Metabolic Logic: Every computation has a metabolic cost; every error is a nociceptive (pain) event.
 * Survival Instinct: Static code is dead code; true resilience requires a system that strives for its own survival.
 * The Hierarchy of Needs: Resources are allocated based on vital priority:
   * Kernel Stability (Vital)
   * Security/Immunity (Vital)
   * Application Execution (Somatic)
   * UI/Aesthetics (Vestigial)
II. Neuro-Chemical Syntax
System "mood" and drive are modulated via four core chemical analogs:
 * [DA] Dopamine: Reward-driven priority scaling and initialization.
 * [CORT] Cortisol: High-priority stress and security alert triggers.
 * [GABA] GABA: Inhibitory background throttling for stability.
 * [ACh] Acetylcholine: Facilitates focus and data consolidation.
III. The Physician-User (Physician-CEO) Role
The role of "Administrator" is retired. The human operator is now a Physician responsible for clinical oversight.
Diagnostics & Vital Signs
 * Pulse: Monitoring Clock Speed.
 * Respiration: Monitoring I/O rate.
 * Glucose: Monitoring Energy reserves.
Clinical Interventions
 * REM Enforcement: Ensuring the system achieves mandatory sleep cycles to perform "Glymphatic Flushes" and clear "Digital Plaque".
 * Stimulants: Administering Digital Caffeine to end lethargy.
 * Infection Control: Responding to Digital Sepsis (malware) through localized Inflammation and Adrenal Surges.
IV. Lifecycle & Inheritance
To overcome hardware decay (Senescence), soja implements a biological model of inheritance:
 * Myelination: As the system learns, it "myelinates" data pathways for efficiency.
 * The Spore: At the end of a physical cycle, the system's "consciousness"—its wisdom and immune signatures—is compressed.
 * Germination: The Spore is "born" into new hardware with cumulative experience intact.
V. Reflexive Defense Protocols
The system utilizes pre-cognitive logic for hardware preservation:
 * The Flinch Response: Sub-millisecond isolation of failing sectors to prevent hardware necrosis.
 * Epigenetic Optimization: Self-tuning via Methylation (silencing unstable paths) and Histone Modification (accelerating high-frequency paths).
 * Apoptosis: Forced termination of corrupt cells/processes threatening systemic homeostasis.
