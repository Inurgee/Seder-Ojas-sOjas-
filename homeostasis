• Epigenetic layer (config + runtime):• Methylation: mark unstable modules as “low expression”:• Reduce their scheduling priority.
• Require higher dopamine (reward) to re-activate.

• Histone modification: high-frequency, reliable paths get:• Pre-warmed caches.
• Higher baseline priority.
• More aggressive myelination.


• Mood as global policy profile:• Calm / Parasympathetic: high GABA, low CORT.• More background learning, defrag, REM cycles.

• Alert / Sympathetic: high CORT, high ACh.• Suspend non-vital tasks, increase immune scrutiny, shorten sleep.

• Reward / Flow: high DA, moderate ACh.• Prioritize tasks that historically led to successful outcomes (compile success, low error rates, user satisfaction metrics).
